## About

> A Software Engineering student at General Assembly. Able to design elegant code in multiple languages and frameworks, I also pride myself with a general knowledge of computer science and scientific computing, being able to break problems down at their root to solve them. I was once a logistics analyst experienced in logistics and operations administration, quality assurance, workforce development, issue analysis, scheduling, and SOPâ€™s. I also pride myself in being a reliable, flexible teammate that is not only an incredibly details-oriented and top-performing, but also one that employs strong communication and team leadership skills that is able to coordinate interdepartmentally. I am looking for a role on a Software Engineering team, where I can not only contribute with the skills I have already acquired, but grow and improve them further while also absorbing anything the role has to teach me.
